# How AI Automation Tripled Catering Revenue: Complete Operations Transformation

![Successful Catering Operations](/img/websites/serving_happy_waiter.webp)

## The Challenge: Growth Strangled by Manual Operations

### Company Background

**Gourmet Events Catering** was a mid-sized Austin catering company with:
- 12 years in business
- Solid reputation in corporate events
- 15-20 events per month
- $85K average monthly revenue
- 18 full-time employees
- Owner (Maria) working 70+ hour weeks

### The Breaking Point

**Spring 2024:** Wedding season hits. Demand explodes. Maria has 50+ event inquiries but can only handle 20.

**The bottlenecks:**

<div className="bottlenecks" style="background: #ffebee; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; border-left: 5px solid #f44336;">

| Problem Area | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| **Phone inquiries** | 65% go to voicemail (too busy to answer) |
| **Quote process** | 2-3 days to prepare proposals (manual) |
| **Order management** | Spreadsheet chaos, frequent errors |
| **Staff scheduling** | 8 hours/week of scheduling headaches |
| **Inventory tracking** | Waste 15-20% due to poor forecasting |
| **Customer follow-up** | Inconsistent, missing opportunities |
| **Event coordination** | Last-minute scrambles, high stress |

**Result:** Turning away $40K+ monthly in business. Team burnout. Owner exhausted.

**Maria:** *"We had the demand and reputation to 3x our business, but our operations couldn't handle it. I was the bottleneck."*
