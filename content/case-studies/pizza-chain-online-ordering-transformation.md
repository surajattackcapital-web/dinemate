# Pizza Chain Triples Online Revenue with AI Ordering Transformation

![AI-Powered Pizza Ordering](/img/websites/taking orders.webp)

## The Challenge: Drowning in Third-Party Fees, Missing Direct Orders

### Company Background

**Artisan Pizza Kitchen:**
- 12 locations across Denver metro
- Known for artisan, fresh ingredients
- Average ticket: $38
- $18.5M annual revenue
- 15 years in business
- Traditional phone & counter ordering

### The Third-Party Trap (2023)

By late 2023, Artisan Pizza Kitchen was **paying competitors to steal their customers.**

<div className="challenge-overview" style="background: #ffebee; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; border-left: 5px solid #f44336;">

**The Nightmare:**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **85% of online orders via third-party apps** | DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub |
| **25-30% commission on every order** | $3.8M paid annually in fees |
| **Zero customer data captured** | Apps own the relationship |
| **Frequent order errors** | 32% error rate (app + driver issues) |
| **Brand dilution** | Customers think they're ordering from "the app" |
| **Phone orders still 60%** | 40% of calls go unanswered |
| **Own website: 8% of orders** | Clunky, rarely used |
| **No upselling capability** | Generic app flow, no personalization |

**The Financial Bloodletting:**
- Third-party orders: $15.2M annually
- Commissions paid: $3.8M (25% avg)
- Lost revenue (missed calls): $2.1M annually
- Order errors & remakes: $680K annually
- **Total annual cost: $6.58M**

**Owner (Derek):** *"We were profitable despite paying DoorDash $3.8M yearly. Imagine if we kept that money."*

</div>

---

## The Breaking Point

**December 2023:** DoorDash raised commissions to 30%. That's **$4.56M annually.**

**Derek's Calculation:**
- If 30% commission continues: -$760K profit annually
- Company potentially worth 50% less
- Future unsustainable

**The Decision:** Build best-in-class direct ordering or die slowly.

## Advice for Pizza & Restaurant Chains

<div className="advice" style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0;">

### 1. **Calculate Your Third-Party Tax**
25-30% commissions = millions annually. That's YOUR money. Take it back.

### 2. **AI Voice Ordering Is Non-Negotiable**
40% of calls unanswered = lost revenue forever. AI captures 100%. Instant ROI.

Apps own your customers. Direct ordering = you own the relationship and data.

### 4. **Upselling Is Pure Profit**
AI upsells 58% of orders. That incremental $9.50 = 90% margin. Massive bottom-line impact.

### 5. **Make Reordering Effortless**
One-click reorder = 3x order frequency. Convenience drives loyalty and revenue.

### 6. **Don't Ignore Catering**
Catering inquiries come to you. AI captures and converts them. $1M+ opportunity.

### 7. **Invest in Direct Channels**
Best ROI we've ever seen. Paid for itself in 9 days. Every pizza chain needs this.
