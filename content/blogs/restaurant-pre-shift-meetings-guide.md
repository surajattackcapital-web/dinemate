Did you know there's a secret formula for running a successful restaurant?

OK, you got us. There is no secret.

Success can be determined by so many factors. But you should consider giving your team the tools they *need* to succeed. One area worth exploring is how your restaurant approaches pre-shift meetings.

Pouring the right effort into pre-shift meetings allows service to run more efficiently and smoothly with everyone on the same page.

In this article, we'll dive into specific strategies and ideas you can use at your restaurant to set up your staff to provide world-class guest experiences.

## What is a Pre-Shift Meeting?

A pre-shift meeting, often referred to as a line-up or staff briefing, is a short meeting involving the restaurant staff, usually held before the start of service.

This daily gathering could involve personnel updates, menu alterations, revisiting service expectations, or addressing concerns from previous shifts.

Pre-shift meetings are an integral part of the full-service restaurant workflow because they are designated times to realign on goals and maintain high service standards. It serves as an opportunity to get everyone on the same page and put their collective efforts into perspective.

### Why Restaurants Need to Nail Pre-Shift Meetings

Put simply, pre-shift meetings are where restaurant leaders and managers create a clear game plan and get the staff ready for service.

In the same way elite sports teams rigorously train to become champions, restaurants must also prep for a busy service.

Think of your team as a machine and your pre-shift meeting as a tool to fine-tune each cog in that machine. This gathering is essential in setting the tone for service. It's a platform where restaurants can address issues and clarify doubts, pre-emptively solving potential troubles that could arise during the shift.

**When coordinated effectively, pre-shift meetings can become the most crucial 15-30 minutes of the workday.**

## The Anatomy of a Perfect Pre-Shift Meeting

Great pre-shift meetings follow a consistent structure that covers all essential information efficiently.

### The 15-Minute Framework

**Timing:** 15-20 minutes maximum (longer loses attention)

**Who Attends:**
- All front-of-house staff working the shift
- Management team
- Chef or kitchen representative
- Sometimes back-of-house staff (especially for new menu items)

**When to Hold:**
- 15-30 minutes before service starts
- Same time every shift for consistency
- Non-negotiable attendance (build into schedules)

### The Essential Agenda

### The Power of Tasting

**Conduct Mini-Tastings:**

- Practice describing the dish

**Why Tastings Matter:**
- Staff can't authentically sell what they haven't tasted
- Personal experience creates enthusiasm
- Enables genuine recommendations
- Increases special and upsell sales by 30-50%

## 4. Service Focus & Goals (3 minutes)

Give your team a clear target for the shift.

### Setting Service Priorities

**Upselling Focus:**
- "Tonight let's focus on selling our new cocktail‚Äîit pairs perfectly with our appetizers"
- "We need to move more desserts. Mention them before guests finish entrees"
- "Premium wine by the glass is our focus. Suggest tastings."

**Service Standards:**
- "Remember the 2-minute check-back after food delivery"
- "Pre-bus aggressively tonight to speed up table turns"
- "Double-check all dietary restrictions with kitchen"

**Team Goals:**
- "Let's aim for zero service mistakes tonight"
- "Goal: Every table orders at least one appetizer"
- "Let's get five 5-star reviews from tonight's service"

### Addressing Previous Issues

**Constructive, Not Punitive:**
- "Last night we had confusion about which server had Table 7. Let's use the section map clearly."
- "We got feedback that water glasses were empty. Let's stay on top of refills."
- "Several tickets were fired late. Let's communicate with the kitchen proactively."

## 5. Q&A & Clarifications (3 minutes)

Open the floor for questions and concerns.

### Encourage Participation

**Create Safe Space:**
- "No question is a bad question"
- "If you're wondering, someone else probably is too"
- "Better to ask now than be uncertain during service"

**Common Questions:**
- Menu preparation details
- Ingredient substitutions
- Pricing or portion sizes
- Service procedures
- Section assignments
- Table numbering

### Use Q&A to Educate

When someone asks a great question, turn it into a teaching moment for the whole team.

## 6. Motivation & Closing (2 minutes)

Send your team into service energized and aligned.

### Closing Techniques

**Rally Cry:**
- "Let's make tonight the best service this week!"
- "Let's show our guests why they chose us!"

  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50; font-size: 22px;">üéØ The Restaurant Pre-Shift Chant</h3>
  <p style="color: #34495e; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 0;">Some restaurants end with a team chant or affirmation. "We create memories!" "Excellence in every detail!" "Hospitality is our superpower!" It might feel cheesy at first, but it builds team identity and energy.</p>
</div>

## Best Practices for Effective Pre-Shift Meetings

### Do's:

**‚úÖ Start and end on time** (respect schedules)
**‚úÖ Stand during meetings** (keeps energy up, prevents dragging)
**‚úÖ Use visual aids** (photos of dishes, reservation sheet, whiteboard)
**‚úÖ Keep it focused and relevant** (no tangents)
**‚úÖ Make it interactive** (tastings, Q&A, quick games)
**‚úÖ Rotate who leads** (different voices, develops leadership)
**‚úÖ Document key points** (post notes for those who missed it)

### Don'ts:

**‚ùå Let it run long** (diminishing returns after 20 minutes)
**‚ùå Make it negative or punitive** (creates defensive atmosphere)
**‚ùå Allow phone distractions** (require phones away)
**‚ùå Skip meetings when busy** (that's when you need them most!)
**‚ùå Talk AT staff instead of WITH them** (encourage dialogue)
**‚ùå Overwhelm with information** (prioritize what's essential)
